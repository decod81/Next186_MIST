# Next186_MIST
Modified version of Next186. Original code by Nicolae Dumitrache, port to MiST by Gyorgy Szombathelyi.

This core implements a vsync/hsync fix and improves cache coherence for eliminating a bug that caused graphical glitches in the original core. Additionally the CPU/SDRAM frequencies have been increased to 70/140 MHz.
